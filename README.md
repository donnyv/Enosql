Enosql - embedded nosql database, based on Chrome V8 engine
==============================================================
This project will try to mimic the MongoDB C# driver as much as possible.  
So that its painless to switch to that when your database grows.  

This project exists because of the great V8.NET wrapper.

If you don't feel like building from source just use these binaries.
